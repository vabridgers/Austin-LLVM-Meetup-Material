18:33:55	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : Must be late there for you. 
18:33:57	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : One day you can visit Germany again and then we can meet in person. :)
18:34:08	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : Yes!

18:51:43	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : everything is fine. later I have a question about bindings with python. but we can discuss this later after the meetup, if you have time, of course. 
18:55:40	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : yes!
18:55:47	 From  bazinga : Yes, everything great

19:18:32	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : no
19:30:37	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : thank you very much for the great insight
19:35:02	 From  bazinga : Any other theorem provers you know that could be used with clang? 
19:35:47	 From  bazinga : and it works with IR?\  
19:36:59	 From  bazinga : yes, thank you 
19:37:18	 From  Anja Gerbes : I have a question about bindings in clang. is cindex.py the only source / binding?
19:37:34	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : yes, chat offline would be awesome°
19:37:36	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : !
19:38:03	 From  Anja Gerbes : I would like to use, yes
19:38:16	 From  Anja Gerbes : great!
19:38:24	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : thank you very much for your help!
19:38:35	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : I have a lot of ideas in my head
19:38:57	 From  realpolitik : Thanks!

19:40:12	 From  bazinga : Ok, great. Thank you for the talk!
19:41:50	 From  bazinga : Bye
19:42:01	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : Hi
19:42:07	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : I will send you an longer email and we could talk via hangout/google mail address
19:42:14	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : or do you like to talk here?
19:42:33	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : That would be fine, I know it's late there. 
19:42:40	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : My email is vince_bridgers@yahoo.com
19:42:42	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : no problem. I am awake now
19:43:04	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : How are things in Frankfurt? 
19:43:56	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : good, since March 16 I am at home office. was productive in my python implementation of my phd. and I would like to use cindex.py there. because all my code is written in python
19:44:02	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : My research interest is:
The Performance Analysis and Source-Code Instrumentation Toolsuite (PASCIT) will ultimately optimize source code for HPC compute dwarfs and analyze the inefficiencies of compilers to increase performance.
Compilers often lack the opportunity of high-level optimization potential in General Purpose Languages as they are constrained by the semantics of the language. In the Advanced Computation and I/O Methods for Earth-System Simulations (AIMES) project a Domain Specific Language (DSL) was defined that has high-level insight. However, while the DSL will take care of high-level optimizations, low-level optimizations embedded in the compiler could still benefit from the additional knowledge.
PASCIT aims to exploit this high-level information. Clang/LLVM is chosen for a source code transformation also for analyzing the compilation techniques of the clang compiler targeted at high-performance computing code.


19:44:51	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : it is only a first insight of my work
19:44:58	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : That sounds really interesting. You're at the HPC center in Frankfurt?
19:45:51	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : yes
19:46:14	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : I really miss Germany. I had a scheduled trip for Cologne area for the Spring, had to cancel because of the travel restrictions. 
19:46:41	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : Wanted to go during Spargelzeit :) 
19:46:48	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : If I got that right 
19:46:53	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : I would be in Paris before easter to attend LLVM in Europe
19:47:05	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : yeah. I love spargel, too.
19:47:10	 From  Vince Bridgers  to  Anja Gerbes(Privately) : Ahh, yes, wanted to do that too. 
19:47:18	 From  Anja Gerbes  to  Vince Bridgers(Privately) : Here are my poster:
